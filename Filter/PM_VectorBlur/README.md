#PM_VectorBlur

Poor Man's Vector Blur...

Blur an image according to a Vector/Motion Pass using the GPU. 

It works, but it's very basic so things like good occlusions or way to prevent bleeding is not supported.

Based on a John Chapman tutorial , thanks to Alessandro Dalla Fontana for the ShaderToy conversion

You can find more info on the original shader page :
