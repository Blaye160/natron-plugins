# AdditiveKeyer


 This is not a keyer, as it does not create a matte that is of use. It is more of a 'relative mixer' or image blending tool. It is very good for separating translucent fine details (such as motion blur, dust or hair) that a keyers with mattes might have difficulties extracting.

 To get it to work requires a lot of prep work on the screen and reference to work with uneven screens.

 It is used in combination with normal keyer that provides the main core of the comp and the additive keyer generates only the subtle soft edges.
